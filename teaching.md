# Teaching


I'm part of a team teaching Python for Text analysis. The course materials were designed and developed by various people and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/cltl/python-for-text-analysis).

If you're following a course I'm teaching and have any questions, please feel free to email me. Sometimes though, it is easier to discuss things in person. If you'd like to drop by, please send me an email to set up an appointment. I'm usually available in the afternoons between 2 and 5 (unless I'm teaching).
