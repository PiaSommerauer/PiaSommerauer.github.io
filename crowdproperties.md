# A dataset of properties and concepts

On this page, I record the decisions and steps a we take in compiling a dataset of semantic properties and concepts. We plan to use this dataset to find out what aspects of meaning distributional representations of words can capture. In (this paper)[https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5430/], we present a pilot study using diagnostic classification on word embeddings. The design of the dataset is outlined in this paper (link to GWC 2019 paper - to appear).

## The task

We aim to annotate property-concept pairs with possible relations between the property and the concept. The relations are based on the following factors, which we expect to have an impact on whether distributional data contain enough evidence for a property to be represented in a distributional semantic model:

* Typicality
* Afforded activities
* Affording attributes
* Variability
