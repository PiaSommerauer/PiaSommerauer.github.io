# About

I'm a PhD student in Computational Linguistics at the Computational Lexicology and Terminology Lab at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Currently, I'm studying the type of semantic information we can find in linguistic contexts and what we can detect in distributional semantic vectors. My supervisors are Piek Vossen, Antske Fokkens and Gerard Steen.

In addition to my research, I'm involved in teaching in our MA programs.

Other than doing research, I enjoy running, swimming and crafts. I used to be a member of a circus group.
