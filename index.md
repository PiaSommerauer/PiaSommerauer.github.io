# About

I'm an assistant professor in the [Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (CLTL)](http://www.cltl.nl/) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I'm interested in how computational models deal with implicit information in language. 

I teach several courses in the [CLTL MA programs](http://www.cltl.nl/teaching/human-language-technology/hlt-course-overview-2018-2019/).



### Where to find me

You can usually find me in room HG13A89 at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Please reach out via email if you would like to have a chat with me. 

### Job opening

Together with Gudrun Reijnierse, I will be working on a project on Computationally Supported Metaphor Analysis (academic year 2024/25). We're looking for two student assistants (each position is for 8h/week over the course of 10 months). If you are interested in working with us, please consider applying!
