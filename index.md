# About

I'm a PhD student in the [Computational Linguistics at the Computational Lexicology and Terminology Lab](http://www.cltl.nl/) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Currently, I'm studying the type of semantic information we can find in linguistic contexts and what we can detect in distributional semantic vectors. My supervisors are [Piek Vossen](http://vossen.info/), [Antske Fokkens](http://wordpress.let.vupr.nl/antske/) and [Gerard Steen](https://www.uva.nl/profiel/s/t/g.j.steen/g.j.steen.html).

[comment]: <> (Currently, I'm working on compiling a dataset of concepts and semantic properties through crowd annotation. You can follow my progress [here](crowdproperties.md).)

In addition to my research, I'm involved in teaching in the [CLTL MA programs](http://www.cltl.nl/teaching/human-language-technology/hlt-course-overview-2018-2019/).

### other things

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy all kinds of sports (but at the moment mostly running and swimming). I'm a knitting and sewing enthusiast and get excited about hand-made things. In the past, I used to be a member of a circus group.

### where to find me

I'm currently working from home. Please feel free to get in touch via email.
